# Problem 3
puts "Q: What is an instance variable in Ruby? Try to find the answer via Google and explain it in your own words."

puts "A: An instance variable can simply be declared by appeding @ to the front.  It can only be accessed and altered from within the object.  These are great, when you want to use similarly named variables in different objects, but want to make sure that one object cannot modify the other."

puts "Q: Use the Ruby documentation (Links to an external site.) to choose a method from the Integer class and describe what it does in your own words."

puts "A: I will focus on the floor method.  I like this method, because it basically just chops off the decimal part of a number.  I find this useful for when I create a random number, and want to make sure that it remains a single digit."
