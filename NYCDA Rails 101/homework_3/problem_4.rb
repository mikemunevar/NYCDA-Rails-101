# Problem 4
# What is the difference between an HTTP GET request and a POST request?


puts("A GET request is basically used in a route to request/get data from the server")

puts("A POST request is used in HTML Forms. A POST includes the data form the form that was just submitted to the server, in such a way that the server can read it. The server can use this data in any pre-programmed way.  In the example of twitter, a POST request is made with a tweet, and in the next screen, then the server responds by displaying the tweet")
