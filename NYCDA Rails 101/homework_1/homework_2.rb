# Problem 2
# Write a function called add that takes two parameters, adds them together, and returns the result. For example, add(1, 2) should return 3.

# Then, add a line that calls your add function with two numbers of your choosing, stores the result in a variable with a name of your choosing, and then prints the result to the screen.


def add(x, y)
    result = x + y    
end

sum = add(1,2)
puts(sum)
