# Problem 2
# Create a new Rails app.
# Remember to commit the code for your new Rails app immediately after creating it! Any changes you make to the newly initialized app should be committed after the initial commit so I can easily see just the code you wrote.
# Create a page accessible at the URL /contact that contains a form with fields for a name, email, and message.
# Upon submission of the contact form, bring the user to a page at the URL /thanks that displays the name, email, and message that was entered on the submitted form.
# Create a homepage accessible at the root URL of the site (that is, http://localhost:3000) that contains a link to the contact page.
